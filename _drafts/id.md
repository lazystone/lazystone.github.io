>The number of random version 4 UUIDs which need to be generated in order to have a 50% probability of at least one collision is 2.71 quintillion.
>
>This number is equivalent to generating 1 billion UUIDs per second for about 85 years,
and a file containing this many UUIDs,
at 16 bytes per UUID, would be about 45 exabytes,
many times larger than the largest databases currently in existence,
which are on the order of hundreds of petabytes.
